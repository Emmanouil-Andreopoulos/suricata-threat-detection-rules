# Suricata Threat Detection Rules

A curated list of custom Suricata rules to detect advanced network threats, CVEs, malware behavior, and unusual traffic patterns.
This repo serves to demonstrate threat detection capabilities and best practices when creating IDS/IPS rules.

|--------------------|---------------------|
| 1000000â€“1099999    | CVE rules           |
| 1100000â€“1199999    | Malware rules       |
| 1200000â€“1299999    | Exploit techniques  |
| 1300000â€“1399999    | Traffic anomalies   |
